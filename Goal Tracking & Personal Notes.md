## Week 1 Notes ##

* Day 1 was pretty okey, there was a lot of talking(different presentations on life at makers,
what is our purpose, what we should focus on what we shouldn't focus on). People here are really 
nice, reminds me of my college days, I feel like I should do more to help both my colleagues and
my coaches, I am blessed to be here.
* Day 2 we started of with a Debugging Workshop by Alice it was really nice, I thought that I
theory I would get it, however when the exercise time came I pair with Ruth and I really failed at
at debugging mostly anything. In the afternoon I paired with Jake on we worked on Boris Bikes, I
think we got up till step 7-8. Overall a good first day.
* Day 3 we kicked off with a TDD Workshop by Kat it was pretty cool, however I feel like i just grasped
the basics of TDD, I still need to use it more, to be able to control it. In the afternoon I paired
with Chris, he is a pretty chill guy, I learned from him to always ask "why?", so I can improve my
understanding of something. We managed to work our way up to 10-11, it was pretty hard I won't lie,
we tried not to use the walkthrough file as much as possible.
* Day 4 must expand this one - some solo work on boris bikes, paired with AJ a little bit learned about
attribute reader which opens up methods within a class, and finally finished with TDD workshops which
finally clarified the process for me. At the end of the day had drinks with the guys.
