You will need to do your own setup from week 4 ongoing.

You can include pictures and gifs in your README.md so that your fellow devs can follow you.
You can do anything with the README.md file and change it up however you like.

To check for randomness you can use Seed (srand method) or
allow(Kernel). to receive(:rand)
