# Feedback #

1. Talk: Understanding feedback
receiving information about your work or other person work

2. How to do feedback skillfully
## How can we make feedback easier? ##
* shift your perspective - feedback isn't negative or positive, feedback is just feedback
* empowered receiver - the receiver is the gatekeeper, receiver improves his understanding of himself
* know thyself -> truth triggers - seems wrong or off target(we all have blindspots)\
               -> relationship triggers - something about our relationship with the person\
               -> identity triggers - undermines how we see ourselves
* understand feedback
* use a framework

3. How do we build resilience?
