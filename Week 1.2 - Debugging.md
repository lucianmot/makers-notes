Debugging

-> Removing bugs
-> Get code to dow hat you expect it to do

-> Bugs? -> Syntax Error (not proper ruby) -> missing an end\
         -> Name Error -> undefined variable method\
         -> Logic -> test -> suing the programing\
         -> Endless Loop -> does not terminate\
         -> Reading error message\
         -> Checking outpout?\
         -> reproduce the problem\
         -> printing

Debugging Process
* read error
* go to line
* use print (get visibility)
* tighten the loop


-> Opening the files and look carefully around where the error is\
-> Talking throug hwhat happenes in the code -> make sure you all get the code\
-> Customize your IDE editor\
-> read the user stories/requirements\
-> print around the line with the problem\
